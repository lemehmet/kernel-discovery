# Ubuntu Custom Kernel Discovery
This tool finds and downloads the latest version of custom Ubuntu kernels.

## Why?
I am using a notebook with an 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 processor, 
which has a different set of power state and is not properly supported by the mainline Ubuntu kernels. 
The only way to find and download the customer kernels is to open 
the [Ubuntu ppa](https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/) page and perform the [same manual steps](https://itsfoss.com/upgrade-linux-kernel-ubuntu/#install-manually).
This tool automatizes the discovery and download process

## Usage
-  Clone the project `git clone https://github.com/lemehmet/kernel-discovery.git`
-  Install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
-  Get help `python main.py -h`
-  Run `python main.py` with the default options:
    -  Discovers the current kernel version
    -  Finds the latest and greatest version in the ppa
    -  Creates a folder for the version and downloads the `generic` versions.
-  Install new kernel `sudo dpkg -i .deb`
